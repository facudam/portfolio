            <p>Before diving into the world of programming, I was fascinated by search engine optimization (SEO) and its impact on website visibility and user engagement. I learned the ins and outs of optimizing websites for search engines and achieved excellent results while applying it to two personal websites.</p>
            <p> Currently, I am pursuing my programming education at college while also being a self-taught learner. I thrive on continuously expanding my skill set and staying up to date with the latest industry trends.</p>
            <p>I am thrilled to apply my programming and SEO skills in a professional setting and would be delighted to contribute as part of your team!</p>
